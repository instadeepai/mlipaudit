Folding Benchmarks
------------------
Folding benchmarks are focused on understanding **MLIP**'s ability to reproduce
folding behavior and structural stability. These benchmarks include **RMSD**
(Root Mean Square Deviation), **TM-score** (Template Modeling score), **DSSP**
(Define Secondary Structure of Proteins), and radius of gyration analysis.
